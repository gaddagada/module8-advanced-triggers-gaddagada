AccountHelper Overview

The `AccountHelper` class is designed to provide helper methods that assist in performing specific operations on Account records. 
This class is intended to modularize the logic used in the `AccountTrigger` to ensure separation of concerns, improve readability, and ease maintenance. 

This class is currently stubbed out. As part of this exercise, you are expected to:
1. Implement the method bodies to carry out the specified operations on Account records.
2. Refactor the `AccountTrigger` to utilize the methods provided in this `AccountHelper` class.

Methods:
- `setTypeProspect(SObject objects)`: 
    - Purpose: Update the 'Type' field of the given Account record to 'Prospect' if it's not already set.
    - Note: You'll likely need to adjust the method signature to accept the necessary parameters.

- `addressCopy()`: 
    - Purpose: Copy the shipping address of the Account to its billing address. 
    - Note: You'll likely need to adjust the method signature to accept the necessary parameters.

- `setRating`: 
    - Purpose: Evaluate certain conditions on the Account and assign a rating based on that evaluation. You'll need to define the method's signature and implement its logic.

- `defaultContact`: 
    - Purpose: Create a default contact related to the Account after the Account is inserted. You'll need to define the method's signature and implement its logic.

Remember:
Always ensure that your helper methods are bulk-safe to handle multiple records efficiently.
